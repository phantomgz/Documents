## 1. Introduction

Security is a major concern in the Zigbee architecture. Although Zigbee uses the basic security elements in IEEE 802.15.4\(for example, Advanced Encryption Standard\(AES\) encryption and Counter with CBC-MAC\(CCM\) security modes\), it expands upon this with:

* 128-bit AES encryption algorithms
* String, U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology\(NIST\)-approved security
* Defined key types \(link, network\)
* Defined key setup and maintenance
* keys can be hardwired into an application
* CCM\* \(Unified/simpler mode of operation\)
* Trust centers
* Security that can be customized for the application

As the following figure illustrates, the security services provider block interactions with both the application and network layers\(安全服务提供程序阻止与应用程序和网络层的交互\).

Zigbee now supports a single defined security mode called **Standard Security**. Various policies exist within that mode to control how devices behave or interact on the network. Earlier versions of the Zigbee standard utilized modes know as **Residential Security** and **High Security**. These have been deprecated.

**Note:** IEEE 802.16.4 MAC-level security is **not** used by Zigbee and is therefore not supported by EmberZNet PRO and not described here. Zigbee implements message security at the network and application layers.

This document first describes some basic security concepts, including network layer security, trust centers, and application support layer security features. It then discusses the types of standard security protocols available in EmberZNet PRO. Coding requirements for implementing security are reviewed in summary. Finally, information on implementing Zigbee Smart Energy security is provided. Details may be found in document AN714, Smart Energy ECC-Enabled Device Setup.

Those already familiar with Zibee security concepts can jump to section 4.Zigbee Smart Energy\(ZSE\) Security.

## 2. Concepts

### 2.1 Network Layer Security

This section describes how Zigbee implements security at the network layer, which applies to standard security. Network security provides security independent of the applications that may be running on a Zigbee node. All Zigbee-certified devices must use network layer security. It provides the basic access control for controlling what nodes are allowed to participate in a particular Zigbee network. For application-controlled security, see section [2.4 APS Layer Security]().

#### 2.1.1 The Network Key

Network security uses a network-wide key for encryption and decryption. All devices that are authorized to join the network have a copy of the key and use it to encrypt and decrypt all network messages.
