# 5. The Zigbee Stack

The Zigbee and Zigbee PRO stacks are complete implementations of the MAC, networking layer, security services and the application framework, Devices implementing Zigbee and Zigbee PRO can interoperate by acting as end devices in the other type of network. For example, if a network is formed around a Zigbee PRO coordinator it can have Zigbee PRO routers only, but both Zigbee and Zigbee PRO end devices.

The Zigbee stack is formed around a centrol coordinator and uses tree addressing to establish the network.

The Zigbee PRO stack if formed around a centrl coordinator but uses a stochastic addressing scheme to avoid limitations with the tree. Table routing is always used and additional features are available such as:
  
* Network level multicasts
* Many-to-one and source routing
* Frequency agility
* Asymmetric link handling
* PAN ID Conflict
* Fragmentation
* Standard or high security

## 5.2 Zigbee Profiles

Before Zigbee 3.0, application profiles, or simply profiles, sat on top of the basic Zigbee stack. These were developed to specify the OTA messages required for device interoperability. A given application profile could be certified on either the Zigbee or Zigbee PRO stack. Now, Zigbee 3.0 has introduced an all-encompassing application layer specification for defining OTA behavior for all Zigbee application:

**The following are the application profile groups that existed before Zigbee 3.0:**

* Home Automation\(HA\)
* Smart Energy\(SE\)
* Commercial Building Automation\(CBA\)
* Telecom Application\(TA\)
* Health Care\(HC\)
* Retail
* Zigbee Light Link

The Zigbee Cluster Library\(ZCL\) forms a generic basis for the Zigbee common application layer. This library defines common elements that are shared such as data types and allows reuse of simple devices such as on/off switch protocols between different profiles.

Application profiles defined the roles and functions of devices in a Zigbee network. Two types of application profiles were administered by the Alliance:

* Public Application Profiles, 
* Manufacturer-Specific Application Profiles,

## 5.3 Zigbee Addressing Scheme

The Zigbee PRO stack uses a stochastic address assignment mechanism.

## 5.4 Extended PAN IDs

Zigbee has added an 8 byte extended PAN ID\(EPID or XPID\) to facilitate provisioning\(方便配置?\) and PAN ID conflict detection. The extended PAN ID is new included in the beacon payload, following the existing 3 bytes.

The EPID is a 64-bit value set for the entire network by the Zigbee Coordinator\(ZC\) at the time the personal area network\(PAN\) is formed and must not change while the PAN is operating\(unlike the PID\). Like the PID, all nodes within the same PAN share an EPID.

### 5.4.1 Use in Scanning / Forming / Joining Process

The following guidelines apply to EmberZNet in determining the expected behavior of a Form/Join action given a particular EPID:

* If an all-zero value is specified for extended PAN ID during FormNetwork, the stack will generate a random 64-bit value for this field.
* If an all-zero value is specified for extended PAN ID during JoinNetwork, the stack will use the 16-bit PAN ID specified in the JoinNetwork parameters as the primary criteria for selecting a network during the join process.
* If a non-zero value is specified for extended PAN ID during JoinNetwork, the stack will use the 64-bit extended PAN ID specified in the JoinNetwork parameters\(even if 16-bit PAN ID is different\) as the primary criteria for selecting a network during the join process.



### 5.4.2 Choosing an EPID

While the PAN ID is meant to be a randomly chosen, 16-bit value, unique to each network, the EPID is often used more like the SSID field of WiFi networks to give them a user-friendly designation\(which is often not so random and is either set by the manufacturer or the installer\). However, Silicon Labs discourages using a fixed EPID for all deployments because\(unlike the conflicts of the PAN ID\) EPID conflicts cannot be resolved if they occur at runtime\(because no other unique information exists to distinguish the PANs\). Customers wishing to use non-random EPIDs should, at minimum, scan the network\(either at the coordinator or through some external commissioning tool\) and check that the new PAN's preferred EPID is not already in use by some other PAN. One approach is to use a small set of preferred EPIDs when forming PANs so that the coordinator can have alternatives if the first choice is in conflict.

OEMs creating consumer-grade products requiring customer installation\(rather than by trained installers\) should take particular care to ensure variety of EPIDs, as two customers living next door to each other may purchase the same product for their homes and would prefer to isolate their networks from each other. If those two neighboring homes were to each use PANs with the same EPID, network difficulties would likely arise for both users because the both homes would be considered as one network, and many network address conflicts could occur.

### 5.4.3 EPID versus PID

* EPID is 64 bites; PID is 16 bits.
* EPID is usually used as stack's criteria for matching to requested network; PID is only used for matching criteria when EPID is all 0x00 bytes.
* EPID is only present in a few kinds of packets\(beacons, Network Update messages\); PID is present in almost all 802.15.4 frames\(except MAC ACKs\).
* EPID is used as criteria for uniquely identifying the network and for resolving conflicts of PID; PID is used for AMAC destination filtering at the radio receiver.
* EPID my help provide some indication of network's identity in the scan result; PID should always be completely random, so it is not as useful in determining which PAN is the "right one".
* EPID can be any value in range of 0x0000000000000001 to 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFE \(all 0's and all F's are reserved values\); PID can be any value in the range of 0x0000 - 0xFFFE\(all F's constitute reserved value\).

# 6. Zigbee Cluster Library\(ZCL\)

## 6.1 Overview

In the Zigbee Cluster Library(ZCL), a cluster is a set of messages used to send and receive related commands and data over a Zigbee network. For example, a temperature cluster would contain all the necessary OTA messages required to send and receive information about temperature.

To facilitate learning and management, these clusters are further grouped into functional domains, such as those useful for HVAC, Security, Lighting, and so on. Developers may also define their own clusters, if the pre-deined cluster do not meet their specific application need.
The Zigbee common application layer then references which clusters are used within certain applications, and specifies which clusters are supported by different devices, some clusters are mandatory, others optional. In this way, the ZCL simplifies the documentation of a paricular application and allows the develper to understand quickly which behaviors devices support.

A more detailed overview of the ZCL, the format of messages within clusters, and a set of messages that my be used within any cluster are descrbed in the Zigbee Cluster Library Specification document(15-02017-002). Functional domain clusters are described in separate documents, such as the functional Domain: Generic, Security and Safety document.

Silicon Labs provides source code to easily assemble and disssemble ZCL messages, whether they are pre-defined by the ZCL or custom messages created by the developer. In addition, Silicon Labs provides a powerful tool called AppBuilder that allows developers to create and configure most of their ZCL-based application. See document UG102: Application Framework Developer Guide, for more information.


## 6.2 Inside Clusters

An attribute is data associated with a cluster end; the server and client ends of a cluster may each possess multiple attributes.
属性是与群端相关联的数据；集群的服务器端和客户端可以各自*拥有*多个属性。

Each attribute declares a 16-bit identifier, a data type, a read-only or read/write designator(指示符), a default value, and an indicator or whether its support by any implementation is mandatory or optional. The following table lists example data types:

Table 6.1 Data Type Quick Reference(Example Data Types)
| | |
|---|---|
|Data Type | Description |
|Binary data types | 8,16, 24, or 32 bits in length |
|Logical data type | Boolean |
|Bitmap data type | 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits in length |
|Unsigned Integer | 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits in length |
|Signed Integer   | 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits in length |
|Enumeration | 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits in length | 
|Floating Point | 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits in length | 
|String | 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits in length | 
|Time | 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits in length | 
|Identifier | 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits in length | 
|IEEE address type | 8, 16, 24, or 32 bits in length | 

The attributes identifier is unique only within the specific cluster end: this means that the attribute 0x0002 within the cluster server does not need to be the same as the attribute 0x0002 within the cluster client, even within the same cluster.

The data types are fully dexcribed in the ZCL Specification.

Blobal attributes were introduced in revision 6 of the ZCL. These attributes are defined for every cluster instance on a device and function as normal ZCL attributes. Cluster Revison(attribute ID 0xFFFD) is one example of a blobal attribute. This attribute is a way to version each of the individual cluster specifications. to improve backwards compatibility, and allow for testing of specific versioned cluster behavior, One device may read the Cluster Revision attribute on another device to determine hwo to communicate certain cluster behavior to them over the air. This Cluster Revision attribute is incremented for every major change each cluster's specification.

### 6.2.3 Commands

A command is composed of an 8-bit command-indentifier and a payload format. Like attribute, the 8-bit identifier is unique only within the specific cluster end. The payload format is arbitrary to the command type, conforming only to the general packet format guidelines as described in the ZCL Specification.

Comands are diveded into two types: global and cluster-specific. Global commands are defined in the ZCL Specification and are not specific to any cluster. These global commands were originally referred to as profile-Wide, but have changed name to fall in line with the Zigbee 3.0 common application layer. Cluster-specific commands are defined inside the cluster definitions in the ZCL funcitonal domain documents, and are unique to the cluster in which they are defined.

**Global  Commands**

Global commands are not unique to a specific cluster; they are defined in the ZCL General Command Frame (sed ZCL Specification 075123r02, Chapter 7). The following table lists example profile-wide commands:

**Table 6.3. Example Pofile Wide Commands**

|Messages Send to the Cluster End Supporing the Attribue | Messages Sent From the Cluster End Supporting the Attribute |
|---|---|
|Read Attributes | Read Attributes Response |
|Write Attributes | Write Attributes Response/No Response |
|Write Attributes Undivided | Write Attributes Response/No Response |
|Configure Reporting | Configure Reporting Respone |
| Read Reporting Configuration | Read Reporting Configuration Response |
|Discover Attributes | Discover Attributes Response |
|Report Attributes | Report Attributes |
Default Response | Default Response |

* Read Attributes: Requests one or more attributes to be returned by the recipient; replies with Read Attributes Response.
* Write Attribes: Provides new values for one or more attributes on the recipient; the reply will contain a Write Attributes Response portion indicating which attributes were successfully updated. and/or a Write Attributes No Response portion for attributes that were not successfully updated.
* Write Attributes Undivided: Updates all attributes and replies with Write Attributes Response; if any single attribute connot be updated, no attributes are updated and this command replies with Write Attributes No Response.
* Configure Reporing: Confiugures a reporting interval, trigger event, and a destination for indicated attributes. Replies with Configure Reporting Response.
* Disconver Attributes: Requests all supported attributes to be sent; replies with a Discover Attributes command.
* Report Attributes: A report of attribute values configured by Configure Reporting command.
* Default Response: A response sent when no more specific response is available (and the default response is not disabled by the incoming message).

Since attributes are always tied to a cluster, the commands affecting attributes specify which cluster and which attributes are to be accessed or modified. Additionally, each cluster defines which attributes support which commands - for example, and attributes may be declared READ ONLY, in which case it will not support the Write Attributes command. Thus, while the command format is not cluster-specific, the attributes it describes and its result on the receiving system are both cluster-specific





**Cluster-Specific Commands**

The payload format, support requirements\(mandatory, optional\), and behavior on receipt of a cluster-specific command are all defined in the cluster definition. typically, these commands affect the state of the receiving device and may alter the attributes of the cluster as a side-effect.

For example, the ZCL defines three commands\(OFF, ON, and TOGGLE\) that are received by the On/Off cluster server. It further declares that each of these commands is mandatory and the payload format for each command\(in this case, none of them have payloads\). The ZCL defines that the On/Off cluster client is responsible for generating the commands received by the server.

## 6.3 Example: Temperature Measurement Sensor Cluster

## 6.4 Functional Domains

As of this writing, the Zigbee Cluster Library defines the following functional domains:

* General
* Closures
* HVAC
* Lighting
* Measurement & Sensing
* Security & Safety
* Protocol Interfaces
* Smart Energy
* Over-the-Air Upgrading
* Telecommunications
* Commissioning
* Retail
* Appliances

Each domain defines a number of clusters that are then used by the Zigbee Application Layer to describe the OTA behavior of devices\(see the following figure\).

![](.gitbook/assets/image%20%282%29.png)

## 6.5 Manufacturer Extensions

The ZCL allows extension of the existing library in two ways: users may add manufacturer specific commands or attributes to existing clusters, or they may define entirely new clusters that are manufacturer specific.

manufacturer-specific commands are identified by setting a special bit the ZCL header and including the manufacturer code\(received from the Zigbee Alliance\) in the ZCL header. This guarantees that manufacturer-specific extensions do not interfere with other manufacturer-specific extensions or existing ZCL clusters, commands, or attributes.

Manufacturer-specific clusters must use the cluster ID range of 0xFC00-0xFFFE.

# 7. Zigbee Compliance

# 8. Zigbee 3.0

Zigbee 3.0 marks the beginning of a new chapter in the Zigbee Alliance. Zigbee 3.0 unites all of the different application profiles into one common application layer. Furthermore, it introduces greater test coverage for product certification, ensuring better interoperability for Zigbee devices in the field. The Zigbee 3.0 document suite contains both revised and completely new material for the Zigbee application specification.

The **Base Device Behavior Specification\(BDB\)** is perhaps the most important new document in the Zigbee 3.0 document suite. It specifies mandatory and optional application layer behavior for any Zigbee product. These behaviors include , but are not limited to:

* Network commissioning
* Network security
* ZDO command handling
* Reporting
* MAC data polling
* Persistent data

See document 13-0402 for more specific information on these items. Because there is now one specification for all Zigbee applications, two different Zigbee 3.0-compliant products in different application domains can interoperate on the same network\(for example, a light switch and a garage door opener can perform separate functions on the same network\).

At the heart of the BDB are the commissioning methods that a Zigbee 3.0 device can use. The methods follow an order of execution, but they are all optional for a device. For example, it may only makes sense for a Zigbee End Device switch application to performing touchlink commissioning, classical joining, and then finding and binding. On the other hand, a Zigbee coordinator gateway application may only wish to form a network. Lastly, maybe a Zigbee Router light application could perform classical joining, and then fall back to classical network formation if it does not find any networks to join. The commissioning methods, and order, are as follows.

* Touchlink commissioning
* Classical network joining
* classical network formation
* Finding and binding

Touchlink commissioning is the first step in the Zigbee 3.0 network commissioning process. A device may choose to perform the touchlink process for an initiator to try and find a touchlink target. A typical example of this interaction may be a switch and a light. The switch may perform touchlink commissioning to establish itself on the same network as the light. See 13-0402 for a more in-depth description of touchlink commissioning.

The next step in the BDB defined process is classical joining. This means finding open networks and joining one using the original Zigbee joining process. Finding a network involves performing IEEE 802.15.4 active scans on a product-defined set of channels. Once a device has found a network that it wishes to join, it may join that network using an install code derived link key, a default link key for a centralized security network, and a default link key for a distributed security network. For more information on the security mechanisms involved in the Zigbee 3.0 application layer, see **UG103.5: Security Fundamentals.**

A zigbee 3.0 application may then choose to form a classical Zigbee network. A product may form a centralized security network as a trust center or form a distributed security network as a router. This is different form many legacy application profiles where only a Zigbee coordinator could form a network. A light may wish to form a network as a router so that it can act as a touchlink target,  whereas it makes more sense for a gateway to form a centralized network as a trust center. Trust centers may choose to only allow only certain devices on the network by using **install code derived link keys** for joining\(信任中心可以选择仅允许网络上的特定设备，方法是使用**安装代码派生的链接键**进行连接。\). Again, see UG103.5: Security Fundamentals for a thorough discussion of Zigbee 3.0 security.

Once devices are on a network, they can perform finding and binding, where devices create bindings to establish application layer links.

For example, an On/Off switch may perform finding and binding to create a binding to an On/Off Light. Again, as all commissioning steps, this step is optional.

As mentioned previously, Zigbee 3.0 also introduces more stringent testing on products. This means products will go through more negative test cases and specific cluster functionality test before they are allowed on the market. Included in the Zigbee 3.0 document suite are the new Cluster Test Specifications. These documents contain test cases for Zigbee products implementing certain clusters. For a product using a certain cluster to be Zigbee 3.0 certified, it must pass the test cases contained within this document for that specific cluster. There is an individual Zigbee document for each cluster test spec. For an example, see document 15-0310, the On/Off Cluster test specification.

Zigbee 3.0 also mandates that devices should support proxy functionality for Green Power, a networking and application-level specification designed for energy-harvesting end devices. Essentially, this means that every Zigbee 3.0 device will be able to process  and forward Green Power messages to other devices with more application-layer Green Power functionality. The Green Power Basic specification and test specification are included i the Zigbee 3.0 document suite.

It is worth mentioning that the 6th revision of the Zigbee Cluster Library\(document 15-02017\) is also included in the Zigbee 3.0 document suite. See section 6. Zigbee Cluster Library for more information about this specification.
