## 15 DCDC Converter

### 15.2 Features

The DCDC module includes the floolwing features:

* Single inductor, multiple outputs.
* Buck or Boost modes\(pin selecable: CFG=VBAT -&gt; buck; CFG=0 -&gt; boost\). This is only configurable through hardware.
* Continous or pulsed operation\(software configurable\).
* Power switch input pin to allow external control of power up in buck manual star mode.
* Scaled\(测量\) battery output voltage suitable\(适合\) for analog-to-digital converter\(ADC\) utilization.
* Internal oscillator for support where the crystal oscillator is not present.

### 15.4 Functional Description

The DCDC converter module is a switching mode DCDC converter supporting Buck. Boost and Bypass mode. It only requires single inductor to produce multiple switching outputs. 

The converter can be operated in continous or pulsed mode. It is configurable through internal registers\(软件可通过内部寄存器配置\).

An internal oscillator is included for use case where external oscillator is not available.

The DCDC converter produces two switching outputs in Buck and Boost modes. They are VDD\_1P5 and VDD\_1P8.
